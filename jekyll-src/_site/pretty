With a touch of creativity, you can turn any old card into something cool and useful. According to MTV Company’s blog, “If half a million people throw away an old credit card, that would make nearly 12,000 pounds of plastic waste” -that's almost the weight of a large elephant! Remember the three R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Because credit cards are usually made from a mixture of all kinds of plastics, it’s nearly impossible for them to undergo the third R. They are perfect for Reusing, though, in some pretty amazing ways as shown here!





Earbud Holders: With an electric drill you can transform your old card into a crafty place

to hold those iPod ear buds that tangle up in your backpack.

<p>Guitar Picks: MTV has a green picks recycle machine that transforms expired credit

cards into guitar picks! You can watch the video about the machine here. If you don’t

have access to this machine, you can cut your own guitar picks out of cards with a pair of

scissors.</p>

iPhone Stand: You find yourself completely bored in an airplane, you pull out your

iPhone and play a movie, but who wants to hold up an iPhone for an hour and a half?

Not anyone I know! With this cool contraption that fits easily in your wallet and is

completely made of used cards, you can watch any movie, leaving both of your hands

to enjoy a bucket of buttery popcorn. You can find the instructions on how to make this

iPhone stand here.

Plant Labels: Credit cards are made to be durable; with a good sharpie you can turn those

cards into long-lasting plant labels.

Battery Card Cover: Most of us have lost at least one battery cover in our lives, whether it

is for a T.V. remote, wireless-mouse cover or a remote-controlled garage door. And many

of us have resorted to the cheap and ineffective method of rubber bands or duct tape. The

real way to go around fixing this situation is to get an old flexible card, cut it in the shape

of the battery cover and wedge it in its place. Its flexibility lets you easily take it out.

Emergency Ice Scraper: Keep an extra old card in you car in case you wake up on a cold

wintry day and find your car windows covered in snow.

Grappling Hook: If you’re looking for some humor, this little devise, although it can’t

be used to climb walls, can be used to snag something off your coworker’s desk. The

instructions on how to make this cool device can be found here.

Construction: They are very useful for applying wall or floor filler, and for grouting tiled

walls.

Cable Organizer: Your credit card was used to buy you that TV, computer, and stereo

system in your living room, andyour credit card can also organize the cords that give

power to these objects. To make this organizer, cut holes a bit larger than each cable that

you want to fit in each hole, then cut a line from that hole, towards the outside of the card

to help you put the cable in the card. For larger and heavier cables, glue multiple cards

together to add more support.

Shoehorn: If you cut them up a little at the ends, they can act as a great tool to help you

put your shoes on.
