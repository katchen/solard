<p style="text-indent: 50px"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are buildings made out of bricks, wood, stone and mud, but salt? That’s

pretty uncommon, but Bolivia’s Palacio de Sal (Translated: Bolivia’s salt palace) is

completely made out of salt! It’s built on the eastern edge of Salar de Uyuni, the world’s

largest salt flat*, 350 km (220 mi) south of Bolivia’s capitol, La Paz. Its ceilings, walls,

floors, beds, chairs, tables, couches and other furniture are entirely made out of salt!</font></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font face="Arial">The Palacio de Sal was originally built in 2007 for the purpose of housing the

large amount of travelers to the Salar de Uyuni in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the

Andes Mountains. The first salt hotel built was from 1993-1995, in the center of the Salar

de Uyuni. It was dismantled in 2002 due to its numerous sanitation problems which were

even more difficult to manage because of the hotel’s location of the middle of the desert.

Its location had required waste be collected manually and mismanagement had created

environmental pollution. But the Palacio de Sal has overcome these problems with a

strict sanitary system that complies with government regulations, including laws that

prohibit licking the walls.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font face="Arial">With furniture, walls, ceilings, and floors made out of a total of 1 million 35-

cm(14 inch) salt blocks, the Palacio de Sal is fully functional with a spa, restaurant, bar,

large common rooms, 16 private rooms, and bathrooms that look like igloos. The spa is

currently undergoing renovations but it will have a dry sauna, whirlpool baths, steam

room, and a saltwater pool. The hotel even has a 9-hole golf course with a hard salt

surface, open from May through November.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font face="Arial">This hotel has become so popular for tourists that there are increasingly more

hotels and hostels* built out of salt in the Salar de Uyuni.</font></p>
