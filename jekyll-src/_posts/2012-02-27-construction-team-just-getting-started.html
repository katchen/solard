The construction team has quickly been multiplying in the last couple weeks. We are currently made up of graduate students in the Construction Program, coming from the Sustainable Design and Construction (SDC), Construction Engineering and Management (CEM), and Design-Construction Integration (DCI) programs.

The construction team will be working in several different capacities. We will not only be ultimately responsible for building the home in 2013 and transporting it to Orange County, but we will also play a significant role in the whole Solar Decathlon process. Possibly the most important responsibility will be to integrate the various sub-teams throughout the design process. This will be achieved through various multi-disciplinary design reviews, target value design, and an integrated and transparent scheduling process.

One of the most critical tasks that was completed this week was to lay down a foundation for the overall project schedule. Milestones were first laid out based on DOE and project-initiated requirements. A high level schedule and course integration plan was laid on top to create this initial framework. To break this down into more detail, a liaison from the construction team to each sub-team has been identified and they will work with each team to educate them on pull scheduling strategies, build intermediate milestones, and track progress throughout the next two years.
