<strong>How did you get interested in sustainability and how are you a sustainable leader in your community?</strong>

<strong></strong>I’ve always been a nature lover. From the time I was young, I would go camping and hiking with my family and was always outdoors. My brother and I also loved trips to the zoo and learning about animals whenever possible. In high school, my love of the outdoors led me to a club called Envirothon, which was a 5-person competition team in the areas of wildlife, aquatics, forestry, soils, and a current topic. My senior year, the current issue topic was climate change and the urban environment. After researching the perils and causes of climate change and spending a year considering possible solutions, I recognized that my passion was in finding novel ways of reducing community resource use. Through college, I took every opportunity to learn more about sustainability and how I as an engineer could make an impact in reducing our resource use. After college, before Stanford, I seized an opportunity to learn more through the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which allowed me to travel for a year to China, India, the UAE, England, and Germany and study green building codes and practices through interviews and policy analysis.

In my community, this passion for sustainable engineering led me to a group called Engineers for a Sustainable World, of which I have been a member since 2007. At Harvey Mudd College, I served for a year as president of the group and led two trips to Kenya to design and install a solar-powered water pump and lighting system for a high school in a rural and destitute region. In my immediate community, I spearheaded a campaign to institute a yearly energy reduction competition among all 8 dorms at the school along with composting and water-saving initiatives. After my tenure at HMC, I have continued with ESW as the nationwide Projects Director helping other campuses set up similar efforts, manage their own projects, and make a bigger impact in their communities.

<strong>How did you get involved with Stanford Solar Decathlon?</strong>

<strong></strong>I became involved with Stanford Solar Decathlon in early February at the insistence of the former Construction Lead, Mike Miller. I had just finished leading Stanford’s competition team in the annual Associated Schools of Construction competition, and Mike approached me about joining Stanford Solar Decathlon. I had been aware of the project since the beginning, but had not joined because I knew if I did that I would be hooked and would pour all of my free time into working on the house. However, when I met with Mike and the other leaders of the team, I saw that I would be joining a group just as passionate as I who would doubtless become some of my best friends at Stanford through our shared interest and devotion to the team. It was an easy decision to say yes, and I’ve been grateful ever since to be a part of this team.

&nbsp;

<strong>What has been your primary focus within the team?</strong>

<strong></strong>My primary focus has been on the construction side. As the Construction Lead, I have been most focused on providing constructability feedback to the architecture team and others within the project. As modularity is a big piece of the competition and the start.home philosophy, I have worked hard with my group to come up with realistic concepts of how to connect the pieces of the home and safely transport and reconstruct every detail. With my team, I have also helped create an estimate for the home and prepare some of the scheduling and logistical details.

While I enjoy the construction side, it has been fun every now and then to break away from that a bit and dabble in mechanical and architectural design. It really helps totally understand the house and all its elements, and I know that understanding will serve me well when we actually have to build it in the future!

&nbsp;

<strong>What has been your favorite part of Solar Decathlon thus far?</strong>

<strong></strong>My favorite part of the project has been the architectural design. This is the first time I will see a project of this size through from design to construction and display, and I was thrilled to be a part of the earliest architectural design process. Getting to sketch my ideas and see some of them carry through into the stage where we are now was fantastic. The creativity of all of our team members was inspiring and something that keeps me motivated within this team.

&nbsp;

<strong>What are you most excited for in the remaining part of Solar Decathlon?</strong>

<strong></strong>Just as designing the home has been my favorite part so far, I am stoked for building the house. Getting to realize what we have been working on this whole year will be phenomenal, and I can’t wait to see the finished product. Sure there will be some challenges, but I know we will create a truly awesome building at the end.

&nbsp;

<strong>If you were stranded on an island, what would be the one piece of technology you would want to bring with you from the Start.Home?</strong>

<strong></strong>Hmm...that’s a tough one because as a construction person, I’m inclined to count the modular house itself as a novel technology, but that seems like cheating! I think I would have to take solar panels with me. At least then I’d have power for my cell phone. I’m never without it, and at least that way, I could charge it and play games while I wait for rescue.

&nbsp;

<strong>Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

<strong></strong>I’m a Ph.D. student, so I may still be here at Stanford in five years working hard toward that last paper or piece of my dissertation. Hopefully, however, I’ll have escaped academia and be working in a field related to building and development. I can definitely picture myself working for a firm designing or consulting on sustainable buildings, but I could just as easily be happy looking at community-scale resource use in urban planning initiatives.

&nbsp;

<strong>How do you stay up-to-date on emerging energy-related technology? Do you have a favorite blog, columnist or website?</strong>

<strong></strong>I have to say that I’m not tied to one particular source over another. I use lots of RSS feeds that go straight to my phone and flip quickly through the latest news as I walk to and from class. In addition to that, I chat with colleagues and attend seminars (for which Stanford is the perfect environment) to stay up to date on the bleeding edge tech.

&nbsp;

<strong>If you had one year to do anything you wanted (money was no issue), what would you do and why?</strong>

<strong></strong>I’m a bit spoiled on this one, as I got to design my own project for a year after undergraduate through the Fellowship I was offered. During that year, I spent my time traveling and interviewing architects and engineers about sustainable building design, guidelines, and policies. I think now if I were to spend a year on my own, I’d head back to Africa and work in the communities with which I am familiar to help residents develop a better understanding of sustainable development and building in their context. The personal connections I felt during my time in Kenya were unbelievable, and I would love to spend more time among those I now count as friends. To be sure I’d do a bit of traveling as well (I would love to visit the rainforests of Uganda, the deserts of Egypt, and the parks of South Africa), but I would mostly spend time working with the schools I know to help them become healthier and economically sustainable.
