The summer weather in Palo Alto couldn't be any better this week. While most of our team, being the Stanford students we are, have dispersed around the world or just started their internships at companies like Facebook, NVIDIA, and DPR Construction, about twenty of us are still right here on campus enjoying the sun and working on the one thing that has come to define our time at Stanford: designing the home of the future, Start.Home. We finished our Spring Quarter with a great team vision for how we will win the competition, along with great support from faculty and sponsors, and this summer we will be developing the models and documentation necessary to achieve 80% CD by October. Not to mention hitting the beach and cooking up BBQ every once in a while.



Follow this blog and get updates week to week on the fun things we do, like educational workshops, Habitat for Humanity trips, conferences, house tours, and learning about both fundamental and innovative ideas in sustainable design. Also be sure to explore the rest of our website, as well as our news on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stanford-Solar-Decathlon-2013/277641402302890" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stanfordsolard" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
