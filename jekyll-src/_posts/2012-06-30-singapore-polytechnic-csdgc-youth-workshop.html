<p style="text-align: left;">Solar Decathlon is a great way to get teams of people to work together; and it can be expanded to people of all ages not just college students. We hosted a youth workshop for a group of students from Singapore and taught them necessary skills to bring their dream homes to reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The day started off by introducing the students to the world of environmentally friendly homes. They were acquainted with the concepts and principles of what it truly meant for a home to be eco-friendly. Next, the students were randomly placed into teams and were challenged to design a home (with some Solar Decathlon constraints of course).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">AND THEY'RE OFF! 58 jokes and 3478 ideas later the students began taking their poster board and launched their designs into reality. It was great to see that they not only absorbed the content about environmentally friendly homes from before, but they were also able to integrate a few ideas into their design's. After many laughs and (due to limited materials and time) scissor "borrowing" the students managed to get their small (albeit grand) homes together and see their ideas come to fruition. They ended their workshop by getting some lessons about how to use Google SketchUp to model their homes in a different way.</p>
