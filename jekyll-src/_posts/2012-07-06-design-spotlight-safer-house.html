This week’s home is designed by the Harvard Graduate School of Design in collaboration with the SENSEable City Laboratory at MIT.  A project initiated in response to the disastrous tsunami that struck South Asia in December of 2004, these researchers and designers strove to create Safe(R) House, a dwelling that would “resist the force of a tsunami as well as flooding.”  Built from locally available materials, Safe(R) House uses four main elements: “a raised platform to facilitate water drainage, concrete core structures that provide higher resistance without blocking the flow of water in case of incoming tsunami, bamboo or traditional woven partitions to create a porous or ventilated skin and a traditional roof structure made from coconut wood rafters and either tin roofing materials or tiles.”  Read more about this project <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/node/875" target="_blank">here</a>!
