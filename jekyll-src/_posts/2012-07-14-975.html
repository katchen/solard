<p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: left">From all the external things that humans depend on most , air will always come first on our list. Unlike food and water which we can go without for a couple of days, we need air to live; only a few breaths short could kill us. Every second, 310 kg (683 pounds) of toxic chemicals are released into our air, accumulating to about 10 million tons (over 21 billion pounds) of toxic chemicals added to our atmosphere each year. Twenty percent of these chemicals are carcinogens,meaning there are about 2 million cancer causing toxins floating around in our air! The increasing rate of pollution has led to a new crisis: the need of more oxygen in polluted urban countries. The first “oxygen bars” were invented in 1996 in Toronto, Canada. Today, though, there are more ways of bringing fresh air to people in polluted urban areas, such as Adam Miklosim’s portable algae-powered chlorella* pods that create fresh air oases by combining chlorella photosynthesis with oxygen therapy.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: left">The pod utilizes a semi-transparent Teflon membrane to create a disconnected feel from the outside world through reducing noise and voices from outside of the pod. The pod is very comfortable for its occupants; it has rail-bound reclinable chairs placed around the middle and solar panels on top to support the artificial lightning inside the pod. The middle hole of the “doughnut” is used for décor light and for an attractive algae fountain of changing, moving green colors. The Algae containers are placed on the underside of the pod, with carbon filters separating them from the pod to filter the algae smell. In addition, the pod includes an air sluice chamber and a sliding outer door.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: left">The Teflon texture outside of the dome hides the view of outside pollution while still allowing 75% efficient sunlight utilization. The pod includes a large quantity of photobioreactors with a series of transparent plastic tubes. Inside the photobioreactors are 5 cubic meters of algae that purify the air and produce oxygen.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: left">This design is still in the prototype stage,but hopefully it will be out in the market soon to provide a pollution refuge in urban industrial countries.</p>
