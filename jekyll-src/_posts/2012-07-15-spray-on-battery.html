<p>In today’s world, almost everyone uses lithium batteries. They are rechargeable,

have one of the best energy densities, and no memory effect*. But with today’s gadgets

becoming smaller, containing a variety of surfaces, and loops or bends, designers are

having more and more trouble placing the batteries in a way that won’t interfere with the

workings of the gadget. The major flaw of lithium batteries is that they contain a block

of inflexible, non-resizable matter that holds the electrons that make the battery to work.

That’s where the spray-on battery paint comes in. The spray-on battery paint developed

by a team of Rice University researchers in Houston, Texas overcomes the major

problem of batteries for designers designing small, irregularly surfaced gadgets. With the

spray-on battery technology, you could have any size battery on a curved surface, rough

surface or on different mediums such as tile, plastics, glass, metal or ceramics. In

addition, spraying on a battery, which takes less than a minute, is much faster than

building a conventional battery that can take more than a hundred times longer to make.</p>

<h3>What makes up the spray-on battery paint?</h3>

<p>Just like all batteries, the battery paint consists of a polymer separator between two

current collectors; a cathode*and an anode*. One version of paint medium researchers

used is lithium cobalt oxide for the cathode, lithium titanium oxide for the anode, and

conductive single-walled nanotubes for the polymer separator. These layers are sprayed

on top of each other with a conventional airbrush. Then they are heat-sealed to make

them insensitive to moisture and to keep from pealing after time. After that, multiple

spray-on batteries can be paired up with a solar battery to recharge them when needed.</p>

<h3>How is this technology currently being improved?</h3>

<p>Currently, painting the layers of the battery needs to be done in a dry, oxygen-free room.

The team of Rice University researchers is looking into a way to make the battery in

normal circumstances, so it can be used by anyone, anywhere.</p>

* Memory effect means the battery loses a little bit of its maximum energy carrying capacity after each use

*a cathode is the positively charged end of a battery

*an anode is the negatively charged end of a battery
