<strong>How did you get interested in sustainability and how are you a sustainable leader in your community?</strong>

<strong></strong>I started working on student projects related to sustainability during high school in Phoenix. I was the president of the school’s “green team,” that put on several earth day events and did research into sustainable design features for a new school building that got scrapped. I also worked on converting a gasoline powered golf cart to run on homemade biodiesel that I brewed with a friend.

&nbsp;

<strong>How did you get involved with Stanford Solar Decathlon?</strong>

<strong></strong>The first week of Autumn Quarter 2011, Derek O. (Project manager, also goes by D-Rock-n-roll) asked me if I was interested in an intense student project. I ended up editing, commenting, and redrafting the initial proposal, as well as brainstorming design concepts with a couple other people. I quickly became the go-to sketchup and design guy for the project after we got the go-ahead from the DOE.

&nbsp;

<strong>What has been your primary focus within the team?</strong>

<strong></strong>I have been doing a lot of the design pitching and initial home model creation. So far I have logged over 300 hours of sketchup time (well on my way to my sketchup-pilot license). Inherent to design is a lot of iteration and dead-ends, which can be a little frustrating at times for a team made mostly of non-architects. Currently I am working on converting the current scheme into a BIM and simultaneously researching cladding and interior finishes. Also I am gearing up to facilitate construction documentation and detailing. (phew! maybe even sleep!)

&nbsp;

<strong>What has been your favorite part of Solar Decathlon thus far?</strong>

<strong></strong>Each time I finish a sketchup model, I get a real rush. I think, “this is the one, this scheme is fantastic.” I also really like the discussions that are sparked from divergent schemes or design decisions; I think it is great to be on a team where people care so deeply about the architectural feel of a space. Unlike construction, structural engineering, or electrical engineering, which are all pretty specialized, people tend to have an intuitive understanding of space and are all interested in the architectural realization of our home.

&nbsp;

<strong>What are you most excited for in the remaining part of Solar Decathlon?</strong>

<strong></strong>I can’t wait to start detailing the interior. I am really excited about trying to create some unique, flexible furniture to complement the flexible and open spaces I have already programmed. I think that this home will be made well in the diagram, but great in the details.

&nbsp;

<strong>If you were stranded on an island, what would be the one piece of technology you would want to bring with you from the Start.Home?</strong>

<strong></strong>… the home, obviously (am I missing something here?)

&nbsp;

<strong>Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

<strong></strong>I see myself finishing my master’s degree in architecture and starting to log hours to become licensed. This process has cemented in my mind my interest and passion for architecture as a practice. The mentors have been really key here. Ultimately, I would like to run my own firm, but I am not going to get ahead of myself. I mean, five years ago I was in high school and I don’t think that I would have guessed that I would be doing the things that I am doing today.

&nbsp;

<strong>How do you stay up-to-date on emerging energy-related technology? Do you have a favorite blog, columnist or website?</strong>

<strong></strong>I usually check Derek O.’s facebook page since I am usually too busy working on Solar Decathlon to check a ton of blogs.

&nbsp;

<strong>If you had one year to do anything you wanted (money was no issue), what would you do and why?</strong>

<strong></strong>Reanimate/Zombify/Kidnap Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Duke Ellington, Herman Cain (sing in the style of Donna Summers), George Harrison, Harrison Ford (as Han Solo), Genghis Kahn, Jack Black (cause why not), and Russell Crow (as Master and Commander)  and storm the world with the greatest band ever, and then sleep, tons and tons of sleep.
