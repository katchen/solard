Welcome to our inaugural "Design Spotlight" post.  Each Friday, we will be posting photos of products or houses that we admire or just think are super cool.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so we'll keep these posts text light and photo heavy.



This week's spotlight is the famous MIMA House, designed by the firm Mima Architects, and located in Portugal.  According to ArchDaily, part of what makes this home so special is the fact that it "responds to the modern dream for clean sophisticated design and bright open spaces, launching in the housing market a dream 36 sqm dwelling which costs the same as a mid-range car."  Sounds pretty familiar!  To read more, check out this <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/192043/mima-house-mima-architects/" target="_blank">article</a>.
