In designing and building a showcase house, it’s easy to get caught up making it cutting edge–filling it with the latest technology, employing the most modern design, making it as “smart” as it could possibly be. While all these elements may be cool or clever, they obscure our true vision, which is, simply, to build a home that satisfies human needs. Anything else is merely instrumental to that end.

<img src="/uploads/2012/05/300px-Cards_1.jpg"/>An informal survey of most homes will reveal how poorly they achieve this objective. Considering the central role a home plays in the life of its inhabitants, its ability to contribute not only to their safety and security but also their health, happiness, and even life satisfaction is significant. Moreover, a large portion of our negative impact on our local and global communities stems from behaviors that take place in the home.

We can break down human needs into two broad categories–neither of which is mutually exclusive–which help us better conceptualize how various elements of the house’s design will more directly contribute toward our vision. We conceive of human needs as internal and external or, less abstractly, personal and global.

We define internal needs as those of people living in the house. Maslow’s hierarchy provides the nice visual metaphor of the pyramid for what we aim to achieve. Of course, the house will provide physical shelter by virtue of its roof, windows, and walls, warmth through insulation and heating, nourishment indirectly via the refrigerator and pantry, and of course water for bathing and drinking. But, as we ascend the hierarchy, a person’s needs become, admittedly, more difficult for a house to fulfill. Can a house help its inhabitants be healthier? Can it help them achieve their innate necessity to be social, to express themselves creatively, to have a sense of agency and control, to develop purpose and meaning in life? Perhaps a house can’t fulfill these (nor would we necessarily want it to), but it certainly can facilitate their attainment.

<img src="/uploads/2012/05/300px-Cards_2.jpg"/>The second, external, set of needs are those of the community. Community broadly includes everyone from next-door neighbors to indigenous tribes halfway around the world as well as the larger ecosystems our actions affect. Through our house, our actions have impact on others. While that impact can be positive –just consider how diminished our capacity to contribute to the world would be if we didn’t have a comfortable place to rest every night–it is, unfortunately, negative in many domains. Here, we are most concerned with the rather large resource and waste footprint living, especially in the developed world, entails. A well-designed house not only runs itself more efficiently in terms of energy and water use as well as waste output, but it also guides its inhabitants toward making choices with less negative external cost on others, without imposing restrictions or limiting how much say one has over how she lives.

Behavioral design, as well as psychology in general, provides us with the tools to better realize both of these types of needs when combined with the already powerful abilities of architects and engineers. We are learning at a faster rate than ever before about both what makes people truly happy (oftentimes they don’t even know themselves!) and how we tend to behave, particularly in ways we neither suspect nor desire.
