<strong>How did you get interested in sustainability, and how are you a sustainable leader in your community?</strong>

When I was growing up, I had little idea how precious our natural resources were, especially in southern California where fresh water was in high demand. In middle school, I started attending outdoor science camps and environmental design classes, and it became apparent to me that my personal habits in water use, electricity use, and recycling could be seriously improved. In high school, I focused on gaining the science skills necessary to tackle the problem of sustainability from an engineering perspective, and in my first summer at Stanford I conducted research on plastic biocomposites that could be manufactured on a net-zero carbon cycle, and as part of that research grant I created sustainability courses and hands-on activities for the local junior museum. I think it starts with pushing yourself to lead a more sustainable lifestyle before you can inspire others to do the same.

<strong>How did you get involved with Stanford Solar Decathlon?</strong>

In Spring of 2011, fellow classmate Taylor Brady asked me if I was interested in helping him put together a proposal for Stanford to compete in the 2013 Solar Decathlon competition. Pretty quickly we assembled a team of students interested in pursuing this project for the first time, and in November we submitted a 30-page proposal with some of the earliest concepts of Start.Home.

<strong>What has been your primary focus within the team?</strong>

I started in a lead design role, helping to facilitate the formation of a team vision and approach to winning the competition. In Spring 2012 I switched to the project management role and focused on <strong>empowering</strong> every member of the team to successfully contribute to the project. I often attend meetings with faculty advisors and potential sponsors, as well as lead our team meetings.

<strong>What has been your favorite part of Solar Decathlon thus far?</strong>

My favorite part of the project has been meeting people at Stanford who share the same passion in sustainable design. When I first came to Stanford, I didn't know how many fellow architects, engineers, and designers I would find that wanted to devote their time to large building projects like Solar Decathlon. But when we first reached out to the community with this idea, it was amazing to see undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students from almost every engineering major answer back with enthusiasm. Nowadays I spent nearly all of my time working and hanging out with this team, and I couldn't have asked for a better group of friends.

<strong>What are you most excited for in the remaining part of Solar Decathlon?</strong>

Stanford, despite being a world leader in sustainable technologies, is a first time competitor in the Solar Decathlon. We have had to build everything from the very start through the dedication and motivation of students wanting to realize their vision of the future. Since then, a community of faculty members, mentors, and companies has joined our cause, and our innovative design is taking shape. I'm excited for finalizing our architectural plans, detailing our construction documentation, and communicating our vision through renders and videos. I'm really excited to actually build the house and show it off on Stanford campus. But I think I'm most excited to just go into the house in Irvine, after the competition is over, collapse on the bed, and sleep.

<strong>Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong>

I see myself starting an architectural practice in either California, New York, or possibly abroad that focuses on integration of architecture, engineering, and construction, as well as a commitment to sustainable design. I believe that out of my time at Stanford, the Solar Decathlon project will be the most valuable experience for my future career.

<strong>How do you stay updated on emerging sustainable technologies? Do you have a favorite blog, columnist or site?</strong>

In addition to <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/" target="_blank">ArchDaily</a> for <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/" target="_blank">Dezeen</a> sustainable design, The <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tags/sustainability" target="_blank">Sustainability tag on TED</a> is an incredible collection of inspiring talks that everybody should watch!

<strong>If you had one year to do anything you wanted (money was no issue), what would you do and why?</strong>

After Stanford I plan to travel in Europe for a year and hop through countries like Slovenia, Germany, and Denmark, experiencing new cultures and meeting new people. Money will literally not be an issue because I'll be trying to live as sustainably as possible.
