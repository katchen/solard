Going to Dwell Magazine's annual convention<a href="http://dod.dwell.com/"> Dwell on Design</a> was any designer's dream: 210,685 square feet of exhibits, presentations, and tours, and other programming.  Focusing on the theme of "modern beyond expectations," the festival was divided into various areas, such as Furniture &amp; Accessories, Kitchen &amp; Bath, or Dwell Outdoor.  Walking through the numerous aisles of exhibitors was similar to an overwhelming shopping trip for every home product you could ever want.  Every. Single. One.

As our team is approaching the interior design stage, our team members had so much fun “shopping” for all of the products that could eventually be part of our Start.Home.  We spoke with several lighting representatives about their products, and fell in love with <a href="http://www.lutron.com/Residential-Commercial-Solutions/Residential-Solutions/Pages/WholeHomeSolutions.aspx">Lutron’s whole home lighting solutions</a>.  It was incredible to see how so many of their systems were in direct alignment with our goal of the seamless integration of technology in the Start.Home.  Similarly, we saw great parallels with <a href="http://www.cernogroup.com/">Cerno’s </a>philosophy of accountability to both customer and environment through the integration of art and science.

Though these are all fantastic and useful products, our overall favorite product was the Heliodisplay by IO2 Technology.  Let’s be real - who wouldn’t want a holographic display in their dream home?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmZ3d3ZnVI" target="_blank">Dear Santa, all we want for Christmas is...</a>
