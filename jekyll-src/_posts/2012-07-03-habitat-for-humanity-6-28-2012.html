One of the ways we're getting out of the design studios and testing labs at Stanford, learning more about construction, and lending a helping hand is by carpooling down to work at the <a href="http://www.habitatebsv.org/about" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Habitat for Humanity</a> build site in Cupertino, where the nonprofit organization is building four homes, each about the size of a Solar Decathlon home (1000 sqft). Our team had already gone once before a few months ago, when the wall frames were just getting started, and since seeing those photos I had been eagerly awaiting the next chance we'd get to build.

When the chance came this week, Taylor and I, despite previous scheduling apprehensions, jumped at the opportunity to stretch our arms and legs. When we arrived, we were cordially invited on-site, pointed to a project leader, and given a brief overview of our task that day. Casually, the project leader told us we would be marking the areas on which the trusses would stand. A few moments later after some confusion, Taylor and I found ourselves pushing a heavy stack of trusses about twenty feet off the ground. It was a long agonizing process, but soon we had the stack in place and we proceeded to make the requested markings.

We did not stick to one task all day. The project allowed us to be flexible and make ourselves available where we were needed. After the marking job, we found ourselves with a large group of Cisco employees and managers actually mounting trusses on one of the buildings. It was intimidating work. Personally, I had to get over my fear of heights and fast moving projectiles while confidently wielding a nail gun on a section of scaffolding. Although it seemed like a daunting task, we were surrounded by a group of capable and hardworking gentlemen (and one Stanford alum) who made the task seem trivial and at times hilarious.

We broke off in the late afternoon, but not before telling our fellow workers about Solar Decathlon and what we hoped to accomplish this summer. They were visibly intrigued and supportive. Many offered words of  advice, encouragement, and even a few business cards. We left feeling more confident and having learned quite a bit. It was quite the constructive experience (pun intended).
