We’ve all used Styrofoam, whether it be in the form of a take-away container, a cup, or some packaging material, but what many of us may not realize is that Styrofoam never truly goes away.  Often our used Styrofoam products are destined for landfills or improperly disposed of in the ocean, but two young engineers may have found an alternative.  Gavin McIntyre and Eben Bayer, co-founders of Ecovative in New York, have succeeded in creating a new, mushroom-based material similar to Styrofoam.  EcoCradle is completely biodegradable, safe, and environmentally-friendly. <a title="Fast Facts" href="http://www.mushroompackaging.com/home/about-us" target="_blank">Here </a>are some fast facts on the product:



<strong>What is it?</strong>



<em>Organic Waste</em>: Food scraps, seed husks, and other plants



<em>Mycelium</em>: Mushrooms do not reproduce by seed, but by spores. When the spores reproduce, they produce single-celled, interwoven structures called hyphae (also known as Shiro). Together, the masses of hyphae are called Mycelium.

<strong>How is it made?</strong>

<ol>

	<li>The organic waste (agricultural waste) is cleaned using a steam heat process for <em>sterilization</em>. (Currently, McIntyre and Bayer are looking into replacing the steam-heat process with a treatment made from cinnamon-bark oil, thyme oil, oregano oil and lemongrass oil to decrease the energy required to sterilize the waste).</li>

	<li>This sterilized waste is then put in a container with <em>growing Mycelium</em> for about 5-10 days, until the desired Mycelium density is acquired. Since Mycelium is a mushroom and does not require photosynthesis, it grows in the dark at room temperature and without any water or petrochemicals.  As it grows, Mycelium acts as glue weaving between the organic waste, resulting in the desired structure. No energy is required for shaping the product because it is shaped as it grows into its plastic mold, which can be customized for preference.</li>

	<li>The final product is <em>heat-treated</em> to stop the spores from continuing from growing.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Why choose EcoCradle over Styrofoam?</strong>

<ul>

	<li>EcoCradle is made using only one-eighth of the amount of energy Styrofoam uses in its manufacturing process and one-tenth the amount of carbon dioxide is released!</li>

	<li>EcoCradle is:</li>

<ul>

	<li>fire resistant</li>

	<li>moisture resistant</li>

	<li>vapor resistant</li>

	<li>hypoallergenic</li>

</ul>

	<li>EcoCradle decomposes within one month after it is buried in the ground.</li>

</ul>
