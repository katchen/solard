First we wanted to thank everybody who was involved in the proposal submittal process for Stanford Solar Decathlon 2013, which has been <a href="http://www.solardecathlon.gov/blog/archives/1978" target="_blank">officially selected</a> as one of twenty teams to compete in Orange County.
<ul>
	<li>This includes the great folks at the Office of Sponsored Research and the SEQ who helped us with our paperwork and administrative process, and showed just how great Stanford is with helping students realize their goals.</li>
	<li>This includes the faculty who, knowing how daunting of a challenge this project would be, embraced the motivation and passion of the students and agreed to support the team as PI’s or advisors.</li>
	<li>This includes the companies and groups that proudly supported an initiative by Stanford students and provided a crucial promotion of our cause in the proposal and on campus.</li>
	<li>And this includes the core, committed students who spent hours putting together a proposal that they felt captured the spirit of innovation at Stanford University, and the community of friends and family that supported them.</li>
</ul>
As first-time competitors we have a lot to do in terms of catching up to the more well-established teams in the competition, but that also means that we have an opportunity to bring something new to the table. We are looking forward to not only showing our mastery of the fundamentals of sustainable design, but also demonstrating some of the next generation technology being developed in the Silicon Valley that will profoundly improve our comfort, productivity, creativity, and community in the home.

If you are a student and would like to join the team, now is the best time! If you are an alumni or professional interested in engaging with the students on their design or supporting them through donations, now is the best time!

Best,

Taylor Brady and Derek Ouyang
Project Manager and Design Lead
